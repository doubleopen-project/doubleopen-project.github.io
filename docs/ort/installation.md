# Installation

## Docker

ORT is easiest to use with Docker. To use ORT with Docker, Docker needs to be installed on the host.

We publish a pre-built Docker image of ORT on [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/doubleopen/ort).

## Native

Native installation may sometimes be simpler to run, for example if the setup
of credentials and proxies is complicated. To use a native installation of ORT,
the needed package managers need to be installed on the host. More information
can be found from
<https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort/#running-the-tools>.
