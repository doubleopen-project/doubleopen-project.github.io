# OSS Review Toolkit

The workflow uses the [OSS Review Toolkit](https://github.com/oss-review-toolkit/ort) for its
Evaluator and Reporter modules. As [meta-doubleopen](./meta-doubleopen.md) creates SPDX Documents
and ORT's Evaluator accepts ORT's own data model as an input, the SPDX needs to be
[converted](./ort-conversion.md) to ORT's data model.
